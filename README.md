# Game Flow
The flow of the game is simple, turn-based gameplay.
1. The program will prompt the user for their name, then it will randomly assign a team of three pokémon to the user and to the team rocket npc.
2. The user is given a list of available moves for use during each turn, but each move only has 1pp (can only be used once) until all moves have been used, then the list of available moves is replenished to its original state.
3. Once one team's pokémon have all fainted, the match is over and the winner is declared.
